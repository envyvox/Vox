## How to add and view bot's functionality?

1. [Click here to add the bot to your server.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1133285884649820260&scope=applications.commands%20bot&permissions=0)
2. By default, the bot requests administrator permissions, but you can choose not to grant them and configure its permissions manually. However, in such cases, some of the functionality may not work due to insufficient access rights.
3. After adding the bot, Discord will load its slash commands onto your server (this may take some time, according to Discord).
4. Type `/` to view the bot's available commands for you to use.
